# Health Hub

Our hackaton project is a deep learning detection algorithm that can identify brain tumors in patient x-rays. This project uses Python, HTML, CSS, Flask, and Tensorflow. In addition to the deep learning feature, the website also includes an anonymous Q&A session to talk to others about brain cancer and a list of brain tumor symptoms.

## Usage (Git Bash)

Install all dependencies needed for this program:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```

Do the following to start the Flask application on [127.0.0.1:5000](url):
