# Classifying between Military and Civilian Aircraft with Deep Learning

Our hackathon project is a deep learning detection type program which differentiates a military from a passenger aircraft. This Github repository contains the Flask frontend of the project.

Datasets, Deep Learning Code, and Model Weights: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iJLlyFM3grgPhNYWgqqjpYMcS09SNta3?usp=sharing

*The model weights file should be inside /HackSite/deeplearning/*

## Usage

Install all dependencies needed for this program:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the run.py script to start the Flask application on [127.0.0.1:5000](url):
